## Welcome, Mrs. President!

Solving the climate crisis will need everyone to contribute in one way or another. But that is extremely hard given that different "solutions" affect people in different ways. And you need broad public support to succeed.

After 30 years of global stalemate, we've realized there is no such thing as a perfect solution. Instead, we need to find acceptable compromises to make any progress at all.

But deciding what's acceptable compromises is when you always have to weigh different tradeoffs is a hard thing to do. Especially if you don't take the time to see the bigger picture and understand how everything is connected.

**And that brings us to why you are here...**

No previous leader have managed to solve the climate crisis - a complex equation of ever-changing variables. People were starting to lose hope. But then, a new kind of leader emerged - one who finally found a way to balance "acceptable losses" with the grand vision of a sustainable future.

And that's why you were elected, Mrs. President. People are literally betting their lives on your decision-making skills.

You have 8 years.

Will you guide your society to a safe, just future? Or will you let the world burn, just like so many have done before you?

Seriously, no pressure. You got this (we hope...)
