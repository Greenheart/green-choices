## üéÆ Play the game and contribute with feedback + ideas for further development

-   Play on https://swipeforfuture.com
-   Let us know what you think on [Discord](https://discord.gg/JGkQr9raU5) or by joining the [discussions on GitHub](https://github.com/Greenheart/swipeforfuture.com/issues).

## üìù Create scenarios and content

Content creation is a major part of Swipe for Future, and a great opportunity to be creative!

### Don't know how to code? No problem!

To contribute scenario content, you could play the game and chat with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/JGkQr9raU5) to help create engaging stories and gameplay. We'd love hear your ideas, and we could help you tell that story or scenario you've been thinking about!

**Fun fact:** While the core game and official scenarios are centered around climate justice and sustainability, the game itself actually supports any type of scenario content.

### Want to contribute with scenario scripting?

See https://github.com/Muthaias/swipeforfuture-content for updated instructions on how to setup the development environment for scenarios.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Install the game locally and contribute code

### What do you need to get started?

-   We recommend installing the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor to get the best experience.
-   You need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

1. `git clone` the game to your computer
2. In the `swipeforfuture.com` directory, run `npm install`
3. Then run `npm start` to start the game locally in development mode. Try it at http://localhost:3000
4. To load scenarios from a specific location, you can use `http://localhost:3000?path=[SCENARIO_URL]`, replacing `[SCENARIO_URL]` with the web URL to where the scenario is available. This feature also works for `https://swipeforfuture.com?path=[SCENARIO_URL]`, allowing you to test even without a locally installed game client.
