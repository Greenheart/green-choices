## üìù Create scenarios and content

Content creation is a major part of Swipe for Future, and a great opportunity to be creative!

### Don't know how to code? No problem!

To contribute scenario content, you can [play the game](https://swipeforfuture.com) and chat with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/JGkQr9raU5) to help create engaging stories and game play. We'd love hear your ideas, and we could help you tell that story or scenario you've been thinking about!

**Fun fact:** While the core game and official scenarios are centered around climate justice and sustainability, the game itself actually supports any type of scenario content.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Develop the game and scenarios locally on your computer

This project consists of the following parts:

- `web` - The core game module.
- `shared` - Shared TypeScript definitions that describe the structure of game content.
- `content` - The development tools used to create scenarios.

### 1. Setup your local environment

- We recommend installing the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor to get the best experience.
- You need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

### 2. Setup the game and scenarios locally

1. `git clone` this repository to your computer.
2. In the `swipeforfuture.com/web` directory, run `npm install`
3. In the `swipeforfuture.com/content` directory, run `npm install`

### üë©‚Äçüíª Start the game in development mode

1. In the `swipeforfuture.com/web` directory, run `npm run dev`. Then you can play at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
2. To load scenarios from a specific location, you can use `http://localhost:3000/play?path=[SCENARIO_URL]`, replacing `[SCENARIO_URL]` with the web URL to where the scenario is available. This feature also works for `https://swipeforfuture.com/play?path=[SCENARIO_URL]`, allowing you to play scenarios from any source.

### üìù Start the scenario development environment

1. In the `swipeforfuture.com/content` directory, run `npm run dev`.
2. If you already have the game started, you can now play the default scenario at [http://localhost:3000/play?path=http://localhost:5000/default.json](http://localhost:3000/play?path=http://localhost:5000/default.json).
3. You can also access other local scenarios by changing the final part of the above URL to end with `http://localhost:5000/[SCENARIO_ID]`, where `[SCENARIO_ID]` matches one of the directories in `swipeforfuture.com/content/scenarios`.

#### More info about scenario development

1. Go to the `swipeforfuture.com/content` directory.
2. Find example scenarios that you can use as a foundation for your own in `swipeforfuture.com/content/scenarios`. The folder name of each scenario represents
3. If you want to add new scenarios, note that the file `content/scenarios/index.ts` controls what scenarios are available in the game.
